# Kenny Store

## Overview

Kenny Store is an online food products catalog application built as a **Chingu Solo Project** for **Voyage 55**.  
Its purpose is to demonstrate full-stack development skills by creating a simple admin-managed store where users can browse available food products and administrators can manage the product inventory.

This project includes both a **frontend React app** and a **Node.js/Express backend** with **MongoDB** as the database.

- **Product Catalog** accessible to any user without login  
- **Image Uploading** for product listings  
- **Admin Product Management** (Add, Edit, Delete)  
- **Protected Admin Routes** using token-based middleware  
- Deployed backend (Render) and frontend (Render)
